## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my solution for the Frontend Mentor 3-column preview card component challenge. In this project, I've built a responsive card component that displays three different options for vehicles. This challenge allowed me to practice my HTML and CSS skills, focusing on layout and responsiveness.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build a 3-column preview card component and make it look as close to the design provided as possible. I aimed to create a layout that is visually appealing and easy to understand for users.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the card component.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling for the card component.
- `images/`: The folder containing all the required images used in the project.
- `design/`: The folder containing design previews for both mobile and desktop layouts.
- `README.md`: This README file, providing information about the project.

## Building the Project

To build this project, I followed these steps:

1. Analyzed the provided design previews to plan out the structure and styling.
2. Created the HTML structure for the card component, focusing on semantic elements and accessibility.
3. Added the base styles for general content, such as font family and font size.
4. Implemented responsive design using media queries to adjust layout and styles for different screen sizes.
5. Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout and positioning of elements.
6. Added hover states for interactive elements to enhance user experience.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using various hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. I've chosen [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting my project. You can view the live version [here](https://victorkevz.github.io/3-column-card/).
